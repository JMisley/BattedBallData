# Batted Ball Data

## Description

This project pulls data from a google sheets file, and displays a bar chart, which allows the user to pick two numeric statistics from the google sheets to see how they correlate with the outcome of the play. Under this is a table which displays the percentage differences from the bar chart. Below that is another table that displays all the data from the google sheets and allows a user to filter columns by ascending/descending order or filter columns by a key word/number. It also features a collapsable interface, which allows for additional data/content to be displayed.
